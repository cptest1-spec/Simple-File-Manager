# Simple-File-Manager
- Uses SDK version 28. Due to Android's storage permission security on android 10+, weve changed it to Android 9.
- version 1.0
- sample
- A.I made
- Made With .java and .xml.
### Features
- Search function. {not recursive}
- Displays names, last changed and items count.
- Has special items/directories. They are "Home" -- redirects you back to /sdcard/ or the home folder. And ".." moves you to the
previous directory.
- Regex searching now works, as well as Case Sensitive.
### stuff
- edit this app, implement anything here, or change the code.
### my problems
- implementing the recursive search is hard via A.I, because of the results options FILES, ALL AND FOLDERS. it was somehow implemented but had many problems when it comes to the options, so we removed it.
you can implement it if you want.
- maybe fork this project and add the recursive searching(?)
- needs better layout design for windows, but ill repeat its just a sample with basic functions.
